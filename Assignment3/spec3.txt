The goal of this assignment is to use what we have learned about Boolean Expressions and Conditionals. The program that you write is a Math Quiz that presents the user with a simple problem to solve. It reports back if the guessed value is correct or gives the right answer if it is not correct.

Please do the following:

You final submitted file should be called MathQuiz_[YourName].cpp file; so if your name is Jane, the file is MathQuiz_Jane.cpp (I will use this name in the example below, but please be sure the change this to your name).
The green entries below represent input at the keyboard.
The program first prompts for a type of problem as below.
Welcome to Math Quiz
What are we practicing?
[1] Addition
[2] Substraction
[3] Multiplication
[4] Division (quotient)
[5] Division (remainder)
Choice: 
The user will enter 1 to 5 to choose the type of problem. You can assume the user will always enter an int. If the user picks an incorrect value, show an error as below.

[1] Addition
[2] Substraction
[3] Multiplication
[4] Division (quotient)
[5] Division (remainder)
Choice: 6
Not a valid choice.
Once a problem type is chosen, present a question with that operation on 2 random numbers (from 1 to 10).
Take the guessed answer as input and verify the result. An example for addition with incorrect entry is:

[1] Addition
[2] Substraction
[3] Multiplication
[4] Division (quotient)
[5] Division (remainder)
Choice: 1
What is 9 + 5? 13
Nope, it is 14.
An example for multiplication with correct entry is:

[1] Addition
[2] Substraction
[3] Multiplication
[4] Division (quotient)
[5] Division (remainder)
Choice: 3
What is 5 * 9? 45
That is exactly right!
A division remainder example is:

[2] Substraction
[3] Multiplication
[4] Division (quotient)
[5] Division (remainder)
Choice: 5
What is the remainder for 9 / 4? 1
That is exactly right!
Use a Switch statement at the top level for Math operation choice (add, subtract, etc.).
Use at least one Boolean variable. For example, you can use a variable isCorrect to be true if the guessed answer was correct and false if it was not.
Minimize repeated code. For example, there should be only one statement in the code the prints "That is exactly right!" (or the one that prints "Nope it is ...").
You will need to use the rand() function to generate a random number between 1 and 10 as below. Note that you will need to include the cstdlib.
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
...
// sets the random seed to current time
srand(time(NULL)); // put once after variable declarations
...
int num;
num = (rand()%10)+1; // now holds a random number between 1 and 10
You will need to use the call "return 1;" in case of error.
The program is required to be well indented (use 3 spaces).
The program should have enough comments so a different programmer can completely understand it. But also, you do not want to over-do it by commenting every line.
Test your program with a variety of different input values.
Add output of sample runs in a comments section at the end of the source code; include 3 runs for (1) incorrect choice, (2) correct answer, and (3) incorrect answer.
Lastly, upload the file MathQuiz_JaneDoe.cpp (or the MathQuiz_JaneDoe.txt).
Happy Coding!
