========================= Analysis ====================================================
Q1. Which algorithm performed better?
=======================================================================================
A: From the performance of the 5 test samplese, it's obvious that
for the length of the string array larger than 20, Binary Search performs better.
However, for the length of the string array smaller than or equal to 20, Linear Search
performs better.

=======================================================================================
Q2: How does the time taken by each algorithm grow?
=======================================================================================
A:The time taken by Linear Search always grows linearly;
After the length exceeds somewhere larger than 20 but less than 5279 , 
the time taken by Binary Search grows in the based 2 logrithm, 
which is significantly less than Linear Search's.

=======================================================================================
Q3: When does the linear search perform better?
=======================================================================================
A: Linear Search performs better when the cost of making recursive function calls which 
will write Activision Records in the stack is cheaper than the linear run time and 
vice versa for Binary Search.
