The goal of this assignment is to use what we learned about variables, numeric data types and input/output so far. The program you write will read information about three products from the keyboard and output a receipt. The last programming assignment may be a good starting point for this one.

Please do the following:

Name your program file Receipt_[YourName].cpp file; so if your name is Jane Doe, the file is Receipt_JaneDoe.cpp (I will use this name in the example below, but please be sure the change this to your name).
Write a program that reads the price and amount (weight or quantity) of 3 products shown below from the keyboard and prints a receipt by calculating the subtotal, subtracting 5% club card savings, and adding 8.75% tax to calculate the total.
 Technical requirements:

Choose the right data types (stick to int and double) for the variables you use.
Use constant variables for club card and tax percentages.
Use augmented assignments  "+=", "-=", "*=", etc.
Use comments to explain any relevant code.
Show computed subtotals and totals with 2 digits after the decimal.
Add output of a run in a comments section at the end of the source code.
Ensure the code is indented correctly.
The output must match exactly to what is shown here; so, note all the spaces, dashes, blank lines etc. shown below.
 

The output should look as follows (the green entries represent input entered):
Enter price (Apple per lbs): 1.30
Enter weight: 2.0
Enter price (Cereal): 3.45
Enter quantity: 2
Enter price (Bread): 1.50
Enter quantity: 3

SaveMart Receipt
123 Main Street
San Jose CA 95135

Honey Crisp Apples            2.60
  2.00 lbs at 1.30 per lb
Honey Bunches and Oats        6.90   
  Quantity 2
Wonder Bread                  4.50
  Quantity 3

SUBTOTAL                      14.00
CLUBCARD Saving 5%            0.70
TAX 8.75%                     1.16
TOTAL                         14.46
------------------------------------
TIP: As discussed in class, get 2 digits after decimal point for doubles by doing the following:
cout.setf(ios::fixed);
cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
cout.precision(2);
Lastly, upload the file Receipt_JaneDoe.cpp (or the Receipt_JaneDoe.txt).
Happy Coding!
